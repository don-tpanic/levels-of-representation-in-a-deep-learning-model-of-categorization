# Cog Dev (Shape Bias) Experiment

## Stimuli
Stimuli for the deep network are stored in ```stimuli```.

## Figures
There is only one figure: ```max_cod_dev_shape_match_line.pdf```.

## Layer Representations
The deep network's layer states for each input stimulus are stored in ```layer_representations```.

## Code

### ```accuracy.py```
Runs and graphs the forced choice categorisation task for each layer and for each triplet.
